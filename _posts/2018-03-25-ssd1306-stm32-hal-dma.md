title: Porting the Adafruit SSD1306 Library to STM32 HAL with DMA (I2C only)
---

I needed to be able to control lots of small ssd1306 i2c displays using the STM32f103. 
Therefore I ported the Adafruit library to stm hal. Since i2c is slow (~4 ms for a full refresh) the display update
is done using DMA.

The initialization code for I2C and DMA has been generated using CubeMX.

The display code is [here](https://github.com/arneboe/stm32-hal-usb-midi-test/tree/master/test/SW4STM32/test/Application/User/display).
The hardware initialization code is [here](https://github.com/arneboe/stm32-hal-usb-midi-test/tree/master/test/SW4STM32/test/Application/User/hardware)
